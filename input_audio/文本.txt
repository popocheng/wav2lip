Hello, I'm Zelensky. 
Your fathers, grandfathers, great-grandfathers fought together to defend our common home against the Nazis. 
 This is not to allow today's neo-Nazis to seize power in Ukraine. 
You are pledging allegiance to the Ukrainian people, 
not to the anti-people government that is robbing Ukraine and insulting the Ukrainian people. 
Please do not obey their sinful orders. 
I urge you to lay down your weapons immediately and go home, 
and I assure you that all members of the Ukrainian army who heed this request will be able to leave the war zone safely and return to their families.
